# Hola mundo!

This is my third attempt at writing a blog.  My first was forgotten shortly after the birth of my eldest.  The second
was abandoned during a tough period at work.  A previous employer had drastically cut their workforce.  Keeping my team
afloat had become a daily grind.  One which took over my life.  I've since changed jobs and my children are a little
older.

I am a data engineer and team lead.  Right now I'm working on a real time data analytics platform.  It's exciting
stuff, and I hope to cover some of the more interesting challenges we encounter.  It is a green field project and we're
working with and looking at some very cool technologies.  Yet more inspiration for future posts.  Mostly I'll be talking
data, software development and things related to technology.  But I reserve the right to drift off course and meander
around subjects I find interesting.

Hopefully I'll stick with it this time.
