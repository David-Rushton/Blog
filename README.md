## Concepts!

- [ ] Any requirements are checked within each build (e.g. if articles require an image then not supplying one fails the build)
- [x] Use APIs to add spit and polish
- [x] Code is beautiful and should always "pop"
- [x] Clean and pleasing to the eye
- [x] Great use of negative space
- [x] Mobile support
