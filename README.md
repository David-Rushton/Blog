Let's try this again.  This time:

## Learn!

- [x] Docker deploy for local testing
- [ ] Fully automated CD pipeline
- [ ] Cloud hosted
- [ ] JAMStack

## Concepts!

- Merging to master triggers a fully automated CD build pipeline
- No pre-steps, except content creation are allowed
- Any requirements are checked within each build (e.g. if articles require an image then not supplying one fails the build)
- Use APIs to add spit and polish
- Code is beautiful and should always "pop"
- Clean and pleasing to the eye
- Great use of negative space
- Mobile support

## Share!

- [ ] Data thoughts and news
- [ ] Profile and links

## Enjoy!

- [ ] Bright, light and colourful
- [ ] Simple, clean and full of negative space
- [ ] Hidden features (console output and feature flags)

## Profit!

- [ ] Cool domain name, that is useful for career building ( hello@david-rushton.com | hello@david-rushton.io | hello@david-rushton.dev | hello@data-news.xxx )

## Issues!

- [ ] Yaml frontmatter.  Maybe [this](https://github.com/cloudbase/powershell-yaml)?
- [ ] Md links should re-pointed to html
- [ ] Local hot debugging
- [ ] Sitemap and robots
- [ ] LICENSE - mine, images, bootstrap and highlight.js
