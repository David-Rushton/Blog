![Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD](https://github.com/David-Rushton/Blog/workflows/Azure%20Static%20Web%20Apps%20CI/CD/badge.svg)

Let's try this again.  This time:

## Learn!

- [x] Docker deploy for local testing
- [ ] Fully automated CD pipeline
- [ ] Cloud hosted
- [ ] JAMStack

## Concepts!

- Merging to master triggers a fully automated CD build pipeline
- No pre-steps, except content creation are allowed
- Any requirements are checked within each build (e.g. if articles require an image then not supplying one fails the build)
- Use APIs to add spit and polish
- Code is beautiful and should always "pop"
- Clean and pleasing to the eye
- Great use of negative space
- Mobile support

## Share!

- [ ] Profile and links

## Enjoy!

- [ ] Bright, light and colourful

## Profit!
