I'm building a blog.  Here are my goals:

## Learn!

- [x] Fully automated CD pipeline
- [x] Cloud hosted
- [x] JAMStack

## Concepts!

- [x] Merging to master triggers a fully automated CD build pipeline
- [x] No pre-steps, except content creation are allowed
- [x] Any requirements are checked within each build (e.g. if articles require an image then not supplying one fails the build)
- [x] Use APIs to add spit and polish
- [x] Code is beautiful and should always "pop"
- [x] Clean and pleasing to the eye
- [x] Great use of negative space
- [x] Mobile support

## Share!

- [ ] Data thoughts and news (republish?  what is the plan here?)
- [x] Profile and links

## Enjoy!

- [x] Bright, light and colourful
- [x] Simple, clean and full of negative space
- [ ] Hidden features (console output and feature flags)

## Profit!

- [x] Great domain name, that is useful for career building
